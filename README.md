# CS-Submissions
Hello there, feel free to look at my working (although probably badly written) code that I have submitted for school requirements. If you're a fellow student that's here to analyze my soltuions, great! If youre here to just copy and paste, maybe at least try to understand the mess I've written first before pressing ctrl+V. Cheers!

Disclaimer:
I do use GitHub Copilot as a glorified search engine for concepts and functions that I am yet to be taught or learn/read about. It allows me to implement features and learn things that would have taken me a lot longer than if I didn't ask an AI to explain it to me. I do still study programming traditionally i.e. books, Google, and YouTube, but Copilot enables me to do cool stuff sooner.
